# ProjectBasedOrgs

Every university has at least one project-based organization, some of the most
notable are Girls Who Code, Engineers Without Borders, and even Hacker Society.
Most of these projects consist of producing quality deliverables under a certain timeline,
and often, project specifications overlap across universities. We would like to create a
database that records different projects universities work on. This can facilitate
networking and ultimately promote efficient, informed progress. This database would
revolve around a project, providing details like the materials/technology used for the
project, the university associated with it, project specifications/timeline, and contact
information.

For instance, if someone from CWRU’s Engineers Without Borders (EWB) is
working on a rainwater harvesting project in the Congo, using this database and the key
word “rainwater harvesting”, they would find that Purdue University’s EWB has done a
rainwater harvesting project with similar project specifications in Guatemala. Having
access to this information would allow any member of a project-based organization to
collaborate with other universities across the country, seek advice about a similar
project they are taking on, and ultimately scale the concept of networking to a new level.
As opposed to reinventing the wheel for every project an organization takes on, we can
make use of this database to work more efficiently and learn from the mistakes of
others.
